Welcome &#124; 你好 &#124; བཀྲ་ཤིས་བདེ་ལགས།།

I am a writer and conservation biologist. I graduated from Swarthmore College (B.A. 14’, Philosophy and Biology) and Harvard University (PhD 22’, Evolutionary Biology). During graduate school I worked at the same desk occupied by Vladimir Nabokov. My dissertation focused on the evolutionary history of the insect-eating *Ophiocordyceps* fungus and the Tibetans who harvest them for a living. Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow at [Andrew Davies lab](https://davieslab.oeb.harvard.edu/).

My scientific work centers around using remote-sensing and molecular ecology tools to study insects and their interactions with humans. Among my current interests are: light detection and ranging (LiDAR), silk moth domestication, entomophagy, and trans-boundary conservation along the Himalaya. See a list of lead-author publications [here](https://little-things-that-run-the-world.github.io/publications/).

I pen a travel column for *Bowu* (博物杂志) in China. I have also written for *Nautilus Magazine*, *Grow*, and *Mongabay*. My new piece is up-coming in *Orion Magazine*. See my portfolio [here](https://little-things-that-run-the-world.github.io/portfolio/). 

In 2014 I received a [Thomas J. Watson Fellowship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_Foundation) to study butterfly farming around the world. In 2021 I received the [Bowdoin Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowdoin_Prizes) from Harvard University. In 2023 I received the [National Geographic Society Wayfinder Award](https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2023/05/31/the-national-geographic-society-announces-the-2023-wayfinder-award-recipients/) and was elected a National Geographic Explorer.
