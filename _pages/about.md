Welcome &#124; 你好 &#124; བཀྲ་ཤིས་བདེ་ལགས།།

I'm a postdoctoral fellow at [Andrew Davies lab](https://davieslab.oeb.harvard.edu/). I graduated from Swarthmore College (B.A. 14') and Harvard University (PhD 22'). I'm interested in using remote-sensing and molecular ecology tools to study insects and their interactions with humans. After college, I spent a year on a [Watson Fellowship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_Foundation) studying butterfly farming around the globe. My Ph.D focused on the evolutionary history of the insect-eating <em>Ophiocordyceps fungus</em> (aka caterpillar fungus) along the Himalayan and Hengduan mountains, as well as the livelihood of Tibetans who collect and sell them for a living. 

For my work (and my writing) I have received a [Bowdoin Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowdoin_Prizes) (2021) and a [National Geographic Society Wayfinder Award](https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2023/05/31/the-national-geographic-society-announces-the-2023-wayfinder-award-recipients/) (2023).

Among my current interests are: light detection and ranging (LiDAR), silk moth domestication, entomophagy, and trans-boundary conservation along the Himalaya.
